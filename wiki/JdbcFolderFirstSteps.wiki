Introduction

    In this page you will find the procedure to follow to use jdbcFolder with two tools : * SQuirreL SQL * Oracle Data Integrator

Configuration

    Download the rhino1_5R5.zip file from the following website :

    Rhino project

    Go to Downloads-> Rhino downloads archive section
    Extract js.jar and add it in the classpath of the java application
    Add jdbcFolder0.1.jar at the java application classpath

The driver class is :

com.ysance.tools.jdbc.driver.JdbcFolderDriver

By now the driver url is fixed at :

jdbc:folder

No login information to enter ( by now )
SQuirreL SQL

    Add the two jar files in the lib directory of SQuirreL an then launch the application.
    Configure a new driver named JdbcFolder and fill-up the field with the url and driver class given before
    Create an alias selecting the JdbcFolder driver. The url is still the same than above.
    Connect and try a select * from /windows query

Oracle Data Integrator

    Add the two jar files in the drivers directory of ODI.
    Launch jython.bat once ( it caches the jars ) and exit (Ctrl+Z).

Configure the technology

    Insert new logical schema ( ex : JFLDR_TEST ) in the File Technology

    Go in the Topology -> Physical architecture and insert a new Dataserver ( ex : JDBCFOLDER_TEST ) always for the File technology.
    Set the driver class as _com.ysance.tools.jdbc.driver.JdbcFolderDriver

    Set the driver URL as_jdbc:folder

    Under the server, add a new physical schema, it can be blank.
    Associate the logical and the physical schemas in a context.

Create a new Treatment

    Add a new line of Sunopsis API type and put in it : OdiOutFile -FILE=C:/temp/list.txt -APPEND -XROW_SEP=0D0A this a file named #filename
    Configure the Source tab with the File technology, and JFLDR_TEST logical schema.
    Add the following query : select filename from /temp

    Save all and execute.

    ==> The C:\temp directory should now have a file called list.txt containing the ligne of files present in this directory ( minus list.txt as it has been created after the sÃ©lection.
    ==> OdiOutFile can be replaced by any other ODI tool, by a jython code line or even SQL, like any other treatment.

The only drawback is that, by now, ODI substitution methods don't work.
